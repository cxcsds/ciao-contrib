Usage:

  ./check_ciao_version
  ./check_ciao_version <local version file>

  Use --help for further information.

Aim:

  Check that the CIAO and CALDB installations are up to date.

  If called with no argument then the tool will check against a
  version file on the CXC web site, and so requires on-line access.

  If called with an argument, the check will be made against the given
  version file. This is intended for testing purposes only, and is
  *only* for CIAO installations installed via ciao-install.

  CIAO must have been started before running this tool, and the
  CIAO installation should have been made with either ciao-install
  or conda. Support for the conda installation is new and not
  well tested.

  If the system needs an update then the tool will exit with a
  non-zero status.
