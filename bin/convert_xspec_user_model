"""Usage:

  convert_xspec_user_model <name> <model.dat>

    --help
    --clobber  or -c
    --verbose n  or -v n where n is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    --local
    --prefix [p]  where p is the prefix for the user model names
    --version
    --copyright

The script should be run in the directory containing the source code;
it follows the XSPEC initpackage command and will compile files that
match

  Fortran: *.f *.f03 *.f90
  C:       *.c
  C++:     *.cxx *.C *.cc *.cpp

Unlike most CIAO tools and scripts this does not use the CIAO
parameter interface, instead it uses the standard UNIX command-line
paradigm.  Use --help for more information.

Requires:

  XSPEC 12.12.0 or later (so we can use the include files from the
  install directory - in earlier versions the install location was
  not usable as the diectory structure had been flattened).

Aim:

Convert an XSPEC user model (written in Fortran, C, or C++) into a
Python module that can be used by Sherpa.

It is based in part on information from the create_xspec_extension
script (provided as part of the Sherpa source distribution) and the
initpackage command from the XSPEC source distribution.

See
http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/manual/XSappendixLocal.html
for a description of the model.dat format.

Convert XSPEC user models into a form usable by Sherpa.

This is *experimental* code and has seen limited testing. It does not
support all possible XSPEC user models at this time; please contact
the CXC HelpDesk at https://cxc.harvard.edu/helpdesk/ if you are
unable to compile a model.

The required arguments are

  1) The name to use for the Python module name; this will be used
     in the 'import <module name>.ui' line to load the models into
     Sherpa. It should not match the name of one of the models.

  2) The XSPEC definition file for the model (or models), which
     is often called model.dat or lmodel.dat

Files that match

  Fortran: *.f *.f03 *.f90
  C:       *.c
  C++:     *.cxx *.C *.cc *cpp

are automatically compiled. The order of compilation is done
alphabetically, as this appears to be what XSPEC does. To include
other files on the link line - e.g. .o files - add there names on the
command line. Note that C++ files matching lpack_*.cxx and those that
end in FunctionMap.cxx are automatically excluded since XSPEC creates
files with these names; please contact the CXC HelpDesk if this is a
problem for your model!

So, if the model is defined in lmodel.dat and the source code is in
mdl1.f and mdl2.f then you could run this script as

  {toolname} mymodel lmodel.dat

and, once it has finished, you would say, within a Sherpa session,

  sherpa> import mymodel.ui

to load the models. The default behavior is to install the models into
your global set of Python packages, so the above can be run from any
directory. If you use the --local flag then you need to either

  a) be in the directory from which you ran {toolname}

  b) you have changed the Python path - by editing the PYTHONPATH
     environment variable or the os.sys.path array - to include this
     directory.

Note that some models may require data files in the working directory,
or for you to set up environment variables.

If the models fail to compile then you can get more information by
running

  python setup.py build

    Notes
    -----
    A rather hacky way to build the XSPEC local model code, which is a
    collection of C++ and FORTRAN, and take advantage of the interface
    that the Sherpa XSPEC model uses (that handles the conversion from
    the user-supplied grid to the one that XSPEC needs).

    The Python packaging ecosystem wants the build to be somewhat
    hermetic, but here I want to make sure we use the same NumPy and
    Sherpa as is installed. That is, we do not make sherpa and numpy
    build requirements but just hard-code the paths into the meson
    build file.

    The build is done as if there is no "structure" - i.e. everything
    in outdir/ - and the meson.build file deals with moving files to
    the correct output location, which is also probably not great.

    udmget, udmget64 : bool, optional

    extrafiles : list of str or None, optional

    clobber : bool, optional
        Do we over-write existing files or error out if they exist.
    local : bool, optional
        If True then use a "develop" build (pip install -e .) and if
        False a full install (pip install .).
    version : str, optional
        The version number (dotted values). The default is '1.0'.
    outdir : str, optional
        The directory where all the code is copied and the Python
        configuration files added.
    namefunc : function reference, optional
        The function that is used to convert the XSPEC model name to the
        Sherpa model class name. The default is add_xsum_prefix but
        options are no_prefix and add_prefix, which would need to be
        partialy applied. The first character of the returned string
        must be in upper case.
