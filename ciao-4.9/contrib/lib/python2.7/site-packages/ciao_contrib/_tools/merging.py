    If parallel is True then the reprojection is done in parallel.

    The reprojection is done by calling reproject_events with
    aspect blank and match set to "<ra> <dec>". This means that
    the EDSER positions are maintained (for ACIS data), but it
    does require that the input events have been previously
    passed through reproject_events or foo_process_events IF
    the aspect solution has been modified (e.g. via reproject_aspect).

    A 'subspace -sky' filter is added to ensure that any spatial
    filters applied to the file will not be passed onto the reprojected
    version, since there is no guarantee that they will be valid.

    The tol parameter governs whether two event files are considered
    close enough to mean that reprojection is not needed; instead
    dmcopy will be used to copy the original file over. The tol
    parameter is in degrees and the default value (1.4e-5) corresponds

    since they can lead to multiple GTI components, as they can differ
    between ObsIds, or - in the case of PHAS - can lead to large file
    sizes and may not have the same format across the files
    (e.g. VFAINT vs FAINT mode).

    If only one file is input then dmmerge is still run.

    *** Special treatment ***

    For HRC data the routine checks that the PI columns all have the same
    range and, if not, removes it. This is because old/un-reprocessed
    data can have a PI range of 0:255 rather than the 'modern' range of
    0:1023. This check *could* be applied to other columns, but this
    is not done at present (for instance the TIME and SKY columns are
    expected to have different ranges). To avoid having a GTI_CPT2
    block the merge creates a temporary file which is then copied
    to remove the PI subspace.

    The support for PBKFILES was removed in CIAO 4.6.
