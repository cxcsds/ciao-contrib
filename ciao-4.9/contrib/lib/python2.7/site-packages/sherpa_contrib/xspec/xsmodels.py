"""
Support for X-Spec convolution models provided along with Sherpa
but currently not exposed for use. This is the set of helper
classes and routines; to use the models themselves import the
sherpa_contrib.xspec.xsconvolve model.

This interface has seen limited testing, so please check the
documentation and then the CXC HelpDesk -
http://cxc.harvard.edu/helpdesk/ - if you have problems.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        The convolution model class (e.g. XSzashift).
    instancename : str
        The name used to refer to this model.

    Notes
    -----
    Creates a model component that implements the given X-Spec
    convolution model. It is expected that a wrapper around
    this will be created for each convolution model, e.g.:

        load_zashift("fred")

    for the convolution model zashift - for instance::

        def load_zashift(instancename):
            load_xsconvolve(XSzashift, instancename)

    There is no validation of model - i.e. that it is a valid
    model instance (a sub-class of XSConvolutionKernel).

    Examples
    --------

    >>> load_xsconv(XSzashift, "fred")
    >>> print(fred)
    >>> set_source(1, fred(powlaw1d.pl))
