      Find the matching ACIS "blank-sky" dataset for an observation
    </SYNOPSIS>

    <DESC>
      <PARA>
	The acis_bkgrnd_lookup script is used to find the ACIS
	background (i.e. "blank sky") dataset from the CALDB that
	matches your observation. It is suggested that you the read
	the following before using the background files in your
	analysis:

	The results of the CALDB search are written to the outfile
	parameter as well as being written to the screen, making them
	accessible by calling <EQUATION>pget acis_bkgrnd_lookup
	outfile</EQUATION>.
      </PARA>

      <PARA title="Output">
	If more than one file is found then they are listed on the
	screen one to a line and written to the parameter file as a
	comma-separated list (i.e. a stack).  This will be the case,
	for instance, if the input file contains data from more than
	one CCD. See "ahelp stack" for more information on handling
	stacks.

	<DESC>
	  <PARA>
	    The script finds the aimpoint, focal plane temperature,
	    and details on the CTI correction from information in the
	    header of the file and uses the ccd_id column of 
	    the event file to select the chips which contain data.
	  </PARA>

	  <PARA>
	    The matching file(s) are printed to the screen and stored
	    in the outfile parameter of the script. We use the pget
	    command to get this value from the parameter file.
	  </PARA>

	</SYNTAX>
	<DESC>
	  <PARA>
	    The input file can include any Data Model expression (see
	    "ahelp dmsyntax") as long as the resulting file is still a
	    table with a ccd_id column.  Here we use a spatial filter
	    to filter the events file: the resulting background
	    file(s) will be chosen to match only the CCDs that cover
	    the region source.reg.

	<DESC>
	  <PARA>
	    In this case the input file is an image, rather than an event
	    file. The list of CCDs to use in the search is taken from
	    the ccd_id filter recorded in the data subspace of the file; this
	    can be seen by using the "subspace" option of dmlist, such as in
	    this example
