    <SYNOPSIS>
      lc_sigma_clip - remove flares from a light curve using an iterative sigma-clipping algorithm
    </SYNOPSIS>

    <SYNTAX>
      <LINE>
	lc_sigma_clip(filename,
	[outfile=None], [sigma=3.0], [minlength=3],

      </LINE>
    </SYNTAX>

    <DESC>
      <PARA>
	The lc_sigma_clip() routine uses a simple
	iterative sigma-clipping routine to detect and remove
	flares from a lightcurve.
	For more information see the <HREF 
        link="http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/filter_ltcrv/">Filtering
        Lightcurves</HREF> thread. 
	The deflare tool can be used to run this algorithm from the command
	line; see "ahelp deflare" for more information.
      </PARA>

      <PARA title="Loading the routine">
        The routine can be loaded into a Python
	interpreter - such as chips, sherpa, or ipython 
	- by saying:
      </PARA>

<VERBATIM>
from lightcurves import *
</VERBATIM>

      <PARA>
	See "ahelp lightcurves" for more information on the lightcurves module.
      </PARA>

      <PARA title="Common arguments">
	The lc_sigma_clip() and lc_clean() routines share a number of
	common arguments and options.
	The filename argument - which is the only required argument for either
	call - is used to specify the name of the light curve to analyze.
	The required columns for this file are discussed in the
	"Format of Lightcurves" section below.

      <PARA>
	Although all routines contain an optional sigma argument, the
	meaning of this parameter is not exactly
	the same.
      </PARA>

      <PARA title="Using lc_sigma_clip">
	The lc_sigma_clip routine performs an iterative
	sigma-clipping algorithm, removing those points that fall
	outside the range
	<EQUATION>mean - n * sigma</EQUATION>
	to
	<EQUATION>mean + n * sigma</EQUATION>
	at each iteration until all 
	data points are within this range.
	The default value for n is 3.0 but this can be changed
	using the sigma parameter as described below.
	This algorithm is robust but not perfect;
	it can easily "overclean" a noisy lightcurve,
	or fail to reject any points, 
	and so should not be used blindly.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	The two options for lc_sigma_clip are
	"sigma" and "minlength". The sigma argument
	determines the value used to clip the count
	rate data at each iteration, and defaults
	to 3.0. The minlength option, which defaults to
	3, is the minimum number of consecutive bins
	that must all lie within the final
	rate limits for that range to be considered
	good.
      </PARA>

      <PARA title="How do we use the output GTI file?">
	If the outfile argument is set, then a GTI file
	will be created listing those time periods which
	are considered to be "good" by the algorithm.
	This file can be used to filter an event file using
	the following syntax (we assume here that the event file
	to be filtered is evt2.fits and the output of the routine
	is called evt.gti):
      </PARA>

<VERBATIM>
unix% dmcopy "evt2.fits[@evt.gti]" evt2_filt.fits
</VERBATIM>

      <PARA title="A warning about low count-rate lightcurves">
	The lc_sigma_clip algorithm excludes bins which have a zero
	count rate, whether it is because the exposure time
	of the bin is zero or because no counts were detected
	in this bin.
	This is because the algorithm is not designed for use
	with low count-rate data.
	Therefore the routines should be used with 
	extreme care when
	applied to data for which zero-rate bins are
	expected (for example a very-faint source).
      </PARA>

      <PARA title="A note on times">
	When run with verbose set to 1,
	durations are displayed alongside time filters.
	These values are instructive, but should not
	be taken as the actual exposure-length of each interval
	because they may not account for
      </PARA>

      <LIST>
	<ITEM>
	  the dead-time correction of the observation (DTCOR
	  header keyword);
	</ITEM>
	<ITEM>
	  exposure variations within the bin due to existing
	  time filters (i.e. the time filters already applied
	  to the observation).
	</ITEM>
      </LIST>

      <PARA>
	The best way to find out what the final exposure time will
	be is to create a GTI file, use it to filter the event file,
	and then look at the EXPOSURE value of the filtered file.
