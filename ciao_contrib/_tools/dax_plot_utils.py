"""
Emulate the sherpa plot commands using blt via ds9


sherpa has various plot commands to plot data, models, residuals, etc.
dax needs to emulate this plots but instead of using sherpa plotting
backends (eg matplotlib), we are  using the BLT plotting available 
through ds9.  This way dax doesn't have to spawn background processes
and keep track of things running in the background to cleanup/etc.
