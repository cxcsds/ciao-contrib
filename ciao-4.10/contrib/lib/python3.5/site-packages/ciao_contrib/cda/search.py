"""
Simple searches of the Chandra archive.

Routines that wrap up access to the Simple Image Access (SIA)
endpoint at the Chandra Footprint Server. As of mid 2018
the URL is

    https://cxcfps.harvard.edu/cda/footprint/cdaview.html

but prior to that it was

    http://cxc.harvard.edu/cda/footprint/cdaview.html

Notes
------

This code can be used but please be aware that it is not
considered stable, so there may well be API changes.

Although the SIA protocol is general, this module is only
designed to work with the Chandra service and may not work
with other access points.

Since the footprint server is - as of the middle of 2018 - now
accessed via https, the ability to download data depends on
if Python includes SSL support, which is unfortunately not the
case for all builds of CIAO 4.10 (primarily OS-X but it may also
affect Linux users using an OS different from CentOS or Ubuntu).
In the latter case a fall through to using the command-line
tools curl or wget is attempted.

Example
