    <SYNOPSIS>
      Summarize the status bits in a Chandra event file.

        <PARA>
            The ACIS and HRC level 1 event files contain 
            a STATUS column which is used to encode
            information about each event.  The state encoded
            in each of the 32 bits is unique to each detector.  Some of the
            bits encode hardware/telemetry problems (such as missing
            overclock values), some bits encode unexpected
            software processing results (e.g. CTI algorithm 
            failed to converge), and some bits are informational
            (coincident with HRC anti-coincidence shield).
        </PARA>
        <PARA>
            The summarize_status_bits tool examines the
            STATUS column in an event file and provides
            a summary of the reasons why the bits were set.        
        </PARA>
        <PARA>
            Unlike most CIAO tools, this script does not have
            a parameter file.  It only accepts one argument: the
            name of the event file, which can include the
            DataModel virtual-file syntax (e.g. to apply a region
            filter or select a single chip).

        This example shows the output running on an ACIS
        event file.  All the events in the file are checked
        and the summary of the non-zero status bits 
        is printed to the screen.            
          </PARA>
          <PARA>
        Note:  since each event can have multiple status
        bits set, the sum of the NumEvt values may 
       be larger than the number of events in the input file.

      HRC event status bits encode many of the
      hrc_process_events test results.  Events with
      some status bits set are still considered to 
      be valid.  Some of the bits are informational
      rather than being used as a selection criteria.

    counts bits from right-to-left, starting at 0, so it will be
    reported as BIT=31.
