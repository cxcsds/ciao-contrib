    <SYNOPSIS>
      Tailor an unscaled blanksky background file to be compatible with a given
      events file; combining and reprojecting the necessary
      background files from the CalDB.  
    </SYNOPSIS>
    
    <DESC> 
      <PARA>
	This script will customize a blanksky background file for the
	input event file, using the instrument-specific background
	files in the CalDB.  By default, due to size, these background files are
	not included as part of the standard CalDB installation and must be
	specifically installed.
      </PARA>
      <PARA>
	The HRC-I background files are generated from exposures when
	the detector is active and not exposed to the telescope's
	optics, manifesting itself as a measure of the particle
	background.  Similar "stowed" particle background files exist for
	ACIS data.
      </PARA>
      <PARA>
	The ACIS blanksky background files used by this script are
	generated by co-adding sets of observations, taken over the
	course of the mission, of relatively empty fields, with the
	conditions of high galactic latitude (|b| &gt; 20 deg) and low,
	soft X-ray emission in the ROSAT All Sky Survey maps (sum of
	R4 + R5 bands &lt; 200).  All observations were performed using
	the entire CCD in standard timing mode with no gratings
	inserted.  
      </PARA>
      <PARA>
	The needed ACIS blanksky background files are selected for
	the observation and then processed as outlined in
	the <HREF link="https://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/acisbackground/#acisbg">"Analysing
	the ACIS Background with the 'Blank-Sky' Files"</HREF>
	analysis thread.  Multi-CCD observations will combine the
	background files for the corresponding CCDs <!--// and the gain
	corrections applied to the observation will then be applied to
	the co-added background file //--> before reprojecting the events to
	match the coordinates of the observation.

            If the value is empty then the ASOLFILE keyword from the
            events file will be used to find the files to use.  An
            aspect solution is required for the script to run.
          </PARA>
          <PARA>
            The aspect solution files have names like
            pcadf*_asol1.fits and are included in the
            output directory of the chandra_repro script.
            To explicitly specify the asol files use
            the stack syntax (e.g. a comma, or space, separated
            string or an external file as described in
            <HREF link="https://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/stack.html">"ahelp
            stack"</HREF> for more information).
            So to use asol1.fits, asol2.fits, and asol3.fits you could say
            <EQUATION>asolfile="asol1.fits,asol2.fits,asol3.fits"</EQUATION>
            or
            <EQUATION>asolfile="asol1.fits asol2.fits asol3.fits"</EQUATION>
            or
            <EQUATION>asolfile=@asol.lis</EQUATION>
            where asol.lis contains the names of each file, one per line.
            The files do not have to be given in time order.
          </PARA>
          <PARA>
            Since there may be multiple asol files for an
            observation there may be more entries in this
