    <SYNOPSIS>
     Combine PHA files and their associated response files.
    </SYNOPSIS>


     <DESC>
      <PARA>
         The combine_spectra script sums multiple PHA
	 spectra.  It will also combine the associated background PHA spectra and
	 source and background ARF and RMF response files.       
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
      Typically only the src_spectra parameter and outroot parameters
      need to be specified, since the
      response (ARF and RMF) and background files will be found
      from the ANCRFILE, RESPFILE, and BACKFILE keywords in the
      spectra. If required, the user can override these settings
      using the src_arfs, src_rmfs, bkg_spectra, bkg_arfs, and
      bkg_rmfs parameters.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
      The output source spectrum will contain the sum of the 
      source spectrum counts and (by default) the sum of the
      exposure time.  The background counts are scaled by 
      the exposure times and areas as discussed below.

            Combine the two source spectra.  The output source file 
	    is called combined_src.pi and
            contains the summed source counts and the summed EXPOSURE.  
            If the files contain ANCRFILE, RESPFILE, and/or BACKFILE
            keywords, the responses and background files will also be
            created.
