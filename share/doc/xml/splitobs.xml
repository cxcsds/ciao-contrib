        Most Chandra datasets contain a single level 1 event file produced from
        a single observation interval 
	("<HREF link="https://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/dictionary/obi.html">obi</HREF>").  
	There are two classes
        of observation configurations where this is not the case.

      This script automates the per-obi file selection to seprate
      the datasets into different directories for both interleaved and 
      mutli-obi observations. The separated directories can then be
      processed as if they were separate observations (e.g. with
      <HREF link="https://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/chandra_repro.html">chandra_repro</HREF>).
    </PARA>
     <PARA>
      Both of these classes of observations are exceptionally uncommon.  
      They have two (or in one 
      case three) level 1 event files that need to be 
      processed separately. The tricky part is separating the
      auxiliary files (aspect solution, mask, bad pixel, biases) that belong     
      with each Level 1 event file, and in the case of Multi-OBI observations
      performed with the Gratings, to separate the correct REGION extension
      for each OBI.

    The multi-obi observation OBS_ID=3764 is split into its two
    OBIs.  The zero-padded 3 digit OBI_NUM value is appended to 
    the outroot and the files associated with each OBI are
    copied into the correctly directory:

Note: as with this observation, OBI_NUM values do no always start at 0 and they are not
continuous. The OBI_NUM values do not have to have been observed in numeric order.

split.

These region blocks are needed for example by chandra_repro when

has also been extracted and a per-obi level 2 event file, evt2, has been
provided in each OBI's primary/ directory

          For interleaved mode observations the script will create

          For multi-obi observations, the script will create

          <PARA>The default value of root is ")indir" which 
          sets the outroot equal to the indir value.  Thus
          if for example the multi-obi OBS_ID 3764 will has indir=3764 
          outdir=")indir" it will create two directories: 3764_001 and 3764_003.
