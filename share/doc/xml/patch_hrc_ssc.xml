    <SYNOPSIS>
      Identify and patch HRC Secondary Science Corruption (SSC) data
    </SYNOPSIS>

    <DESC>
       <PARA>
  SSC results from a byte-shift anomaly which occasionally causes a
  portion of the housekeeping data to be corrupted.  The symptom is
  dropouts in the dead-time-factor (dtf) which can be seen in a plot
  of the dtf1 file's dtf valuse vs time, where the dtf is
  significantly (&gt;10%) below the median value (~1.0).
    </PARA>
       <PARA>

  In the dtf1 file are several rate columns.  The one that seems to
  reliably flag SSC is the TOTAL_EVT_COUNT, when it is anomalously
  high, with values &gt; 4000 (2000 count/s; the default binning is 2s,
  the dtf file values are integrated over time bins)
    </PARA>
       <PARA>

  Event data are good during the SSC times.  Standard data
  processing, however, will create multiple GTI intervals around the
  low dtf times, rejecting some events, and lowering the
  dead-time-correction factor (DTDOR).
    </PARA>
       <PARA>

  Note: telemetry saturation from a bright source can also cause
  lower dtf values.  That tends to be a more continuous and sustained
  lowering of the value.  Hence, inspection of the dtf and
  total_evt_count vs time is recommended.

   <ADESC title="Changes in scripts 4.18.0 (December 2025) release">
     <PARA>
        The previous version of this script simply entirely removed the
        high-voltage checks from the good time interval calculations
        since the values may be inaccurate during times of
        high total event counts. This could lead to periods of time
        at the beginning of observations being included in the
        good time intervals even though the detector was not ready.
        For long observations this extra time is negligible; however, for
        short observations it can lead to inaccurate count rate estimates.
        This version of the script changes the logic to only omit the
        high voltage check if the total event counts is above the threshold
        parameter.
