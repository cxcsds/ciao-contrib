    <DESC>
      <PARA>
	The &tool; tool will compile a &xspec; user model into a form
	usable by Sherpa; it is therefore similar to the "initpackage"
	command in &xspec;.  Unlike the initpackage command, this
	script does not require that the &xspec; source package is
	installed, and is not run from Sherpa but the command line.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	This script is *experimental* and will not work
	for all models; please see the "Known Problems"
	section below for more information and contact the
	<HREF link="https://cxc.harvard.edu/helpdesk/">CXC HelpDesk</HREF>
	if you find problems or models that it will not compile.
	At present any model requiring access to the udmget
	&xspec; routine is not supported.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	The script takes the model file - often called model.dat or
	lmodel.dat - and the source code in the working directory,
	using them to create a Python module consisting of the
	compiled model and some supporting Python code that creates
	the Sherpa model.  The output is a Python module, whose name
	is the first argument to the script. This can be loaded into
	Sherpa by saying (assuming that you ran '&tool; relxill ...'):
      </PARA>

	<SYNTAX>
	  <LINE>&spr; import relxill.ui</LINE>
	</SYNTAX>
      </PARA>

      <PARA title="Loading the module">
	By default the module is installed globally, so that this
	import should work from any directory, but you can use the
	--local flag to build a version of the code that requires
	either changing to the directory you ran &tool;, or
	by adding the directory to the Python path list.
      </PARA>

      <PARA title="Using the models">
	At this point the models can then be used; the default
	behavior of the script is to add the prefix "xsum"
	to the model name (in a similar manner to how Sherpa uses
	the prefix "xs" for the &xspec; models), but this
	can be changed using the --prefix flag, as shown
	below in the examples.
      </PARA>

      <PARA title="Table models">
	Sherpa already supports additive and multiplicative
	table models using the
	<HREF link="https://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/load_xstable_model.html">load_xstable_model</HREF>
	command; this was added in CIAO 4.9
        and replaces the support for XSPEC table models in
        the
	<HREF link="https://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/load_table_model.html">load_table_model</HREF>
        command.

	<DESC>
	  <PARA>
	    The mymodel module is created, which contains the model(s)
	    defined in the file lmodel.dat and with code in mdl.f.
	    In this example it defines two models called, imaginatively
	    enough, mdl1 (additive) and mdl2 (multiplicative).
	    If the script completes successfully then it will have
	    created the directory mymodel/, and you can then load
	    it into Sherpa with the command:

	    </SYNTAX>
	  </PARA>
	  <PARA>
	    At this point any additive, convolutionn, and multiplicative models
	    will be available using the &xspec; name with the prefix
	    "xsum". So, (assuming mdl2 has an alpha component), we can
	    use them as any other XSPEC model:

	  <PARA>
	    When the "model.ui" module is loaded a line is displayed for
	    each model that is added to Sherpa. This output is controlled
	    by the Sherpa logging interface and can be turned off
	    temporarily, as shown above, to hide this output. Note that
	    the final line, re-setting the level, should not be forgotten
	    or else you may miss useful information from Sherpa
	    functions.

	<SYNTAX>
	  <LINE>&upr; &tool; mymodel2 lmodel.dat --prefix</LINE>
	</SYNTAX>
	<DESC>
	  <PARA>
	    In this case the model names are not preceeded by "xsum",
	    as in the example above, because the --prefix argument has
	    been given. This means that instead of saying
	    xsummdl1.mdl you would just say mdl1.mdl.
	  </PARA>
	  <PARA>
	    Note that there is only a limited check that the model names do not
	    match existing Sherpa models or function names, so there
	    is a chance for confusion.
	  </PARA>
	  <PARA>
	    To use a different prefix than "xsum" supply an argument to
	    the --prefix flag, but it must start with a capital letter -
	    e.g.
	    <EQUATION>--prefix XS</EQUATION>
	    would make the model name be xsmdl1 rather than xsummdl1.mdl.
	    The requirement for a capital letter is because the name is
	    also used to create a Python class (this class is not used
	    in normal use of Sherpa).

	    Here the models in the file lmodel_polar.dat - with C code
	    automatically picked up from the polar.c and polarutils.c

	    This builds the module "foo" but does not install

	Models can automatically be loaded into Sherpa by taking
	advantage of the IPython startup directory. Any Python file
	in $HOME/.ipython-ciao/profile_sherpa/startup/ will be
	loaded when Sherpa is started up, so add a file to this

# The carbatm model needs to know where the data files are

      <PARA title="Language support">
	All the languages supported by &xspec; user models - i.e.
	C, C++, and Fortran - should be supported, as long

	Models that need to be re-evaluated per spectrum

	When using convolution models, one possible
	problem is if you have ignored an energy - or

	then it may be possible that the convolution
	will not properly account for edge effects.
      </PARA>
      <PARA title="Choice of module name">
	The first argument to &tool; is used to
	create a Python module of the same name that can then
	be loaded into Sherpa or a Python script.
	It can not match the name of one of the models (once
	the prefix value has been added), and it
	should not match other Python modules or common symbols,
	otherwise it could confuse users.
	There is only limited checking to see whether there

      <PARA title="Accessing &xspec; routines">
	The default behavior is to try and link against the

	The equivalent location of the spectral/xspec/

	The model definition file is parsed to extract all the models,

	models into a Sherpa session.
	The model class names are created by appending the
	model name from the definition file to the prefix
	value (which defaults to "XS"); since Python class
