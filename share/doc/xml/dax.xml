   <SYNOPSIS>
       Run CIAO tasks from the ds9 Analysis menu
   </SYNOPSIS>


   <DESC>
      <PARA>
	A number of common CIAO tasks are available from the ds9
        Analysis menu.  This menu addition allows users to get source
        counts, smooth an image, and create a histogram - among many
        other things - from the ds9 program in CIAO.  The analysis
        menu tasks are known as "dax" (ds9 analysis
        extensions).
      </PARA>

      <PARA title="Getting Started">
	The commands are stored in the file
	$ASCDS_INSTALL/contrib/config/ciao.ds9 and are
	automatically loaded when ds9 is launched within CIAO.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	The user can also explicitly point to the file in the ds9
	-analysis switch:	 
      </PARA>
      <VERBATIM>
unix% ds9 -analysis $ASCDS_INSTALL/contrib/config/ciao.ds9 ...
      </VERBATIM>

      <PARA title="Using the Tools">
	Under ds9's Analysis menu, at the bottom will be a "CIAO tools (DAX)" 
	option.   Selecting "CIAO tools (DAX)" will display the category of CIAO tasks :
      </PARA>

      <LIST>
        <ITEM> 
           Statistics: use the defined regions to calculate
           counts, centroid, min pixel value, max pixel value, etc. 
        </ITEM>
        <ITEM>
           Histograms: create spectra, lightcurves, and radial
	   profiles, for example. 
        </ITEM>
        <ITEM>
           Coordinates: Obtain coordinates for a region center or crosshair 
           in various Chandra coordinate systems:  chips, detector, 
           sky, celestial.
        </ITEM>
        <ITEM>
           Detect: run source detection tools on images.
        </ITEM>
        <ITEM>
           Regions: generate regions that enclose a fraction of flux,
	   magic-wand style source selector (local contouring).
        </ITEM>
        <ITEM>
           Sherpa: extract and fit spectra, 2D images, or radial profiles.
        </ITEM>

        <ITEM>
           Image Processing: adaptive smooth (including csmooth),
	   adaptive bin, smooth (various kernels), non-linear
	   filtering (median), fill in where sources have been removed
	   (dmfilth), and more options. 
        </ITEM>
      </LIST>

      <PARA title="Calculating the Statistics">
	The options under the Statistics item use the combination of
	all defined regions to calculate the quantities.  To exclude
	certain areas, define a region and use the "Region -&gt;
	Properties" menu to set it to "exclude".  If no regions are
	defined, the calculations are run on the entire image
	created at the current binning value. 
      </PARA>

      <PARA title="Plotting">
    Plotting is done using the built in ds9 "BLT" plotting package.
    User can use the menu bar on the plot window to change
    the axes to log scale, change fonts and colors, etc.
    
      </PARA>
</DESC>


<ADESC title="Changes in the 4.12.2 (April 2020) release">

  <PARA>
    Updated the CIAO -&gt; Regions -&gt; PSF Fraction task to force regions in
    ds9 format.  This update prevents dax from hanging when 
    users have modified their preferences to save regions in 
    ciao format.
  </PARA>

  <PARA>
    Fix problem with Net Counts task where background counts
    and area are incorrectly reported as '0'.  Net rate errors 
    are now included in the Net Counts task.  Also now verifies a
    single unique instance of ds9 is running.
  </PARA>
  <PARA>
    The spectral fit and radial fit tasks now use a common 
    set of plotting routines.  The plots have been rearranged
    so that the model is now drawn on top of the data.
  </PARA>
  <PARA>
    The list of spectral models has been expanded.  Users can
    also now specify a 2nd model component to be added to the
    first.
  </PARA>
  <PARA>
    New:  CIAO -&gt; Coordinates -&gt; Chandra Grating Energy Lookup.
    Users draw a region around the 0th order location; when this 
    task is run, it will prompt the user for a list of Energies and
    Orders.  The location of these energies and orders will be 
    identified on the image.   Only for Chandra observation which 
    used the gratings (HETG or LETG). 
  </PARA>
  <PARA>
    The Detect -&gt; celldetect task now allows users to change the
    fixed cellsize that is used.  
  </PARA>

  <PARA>
    New: Detect -&gt; wavdetect task is now available.  Users select the
    wavelet scales which are used.  Note: This task can be very slow for
    large images.  wavdetect is run without an exposure map and without a 
    PSF map; therefore there will tend to be spurious source detected at the
    edge of the field of view and sources will be reconstructed using the
    smallest wavelet they were detected at (possibly smaller than PSF).
  </PARA>

  <PARA>
    New Image Processing -&gt; Regrid task which allows the user to 
    shift, scale, and rotate image pixel values.  This task 
    intentionally does not adjust the WCS.  
  </PARA>

  <PARA>
    New Chandra PSF -&gt; Simulate PSF with MARX task allows users to
    simulate a monochromatic PSF using MARX.  
  </PARA>

  <PARA>
    New Create Custom Color Lookup Table task allows user to generate a
    new color map based on standard X11 color names, eg from black to 
    cadetblue, to white.
  </PARA>

  <PARA>
    New: Histogram -&gt; Dither Region computes the fraction of the
    region area exposed vs. time due to dither for Chandra datasets.
  </PARA>

  <PARA>
    New: Histogram -&gt; Enclosed Counts Fraction computes the ECF
    in the selected region.
  </PARA>
  <PARA>
    New: Calculator tasks allow users to perform simple arithmetic
    calculations (add, multiply, divide, subtract) using the images
    displayed in 2 frames.  Additional scaling functions are
    provided for the current frame.
  </PARA>
