    <SYNOPSIS>

    <DESC>

	The &mname; script takes a stack of event files and
	reprojects them to the same tangent point,
	merges them,
	creates	exposure maps for each observation, and divides the resulting
	images to produce a coadded, exposure-corrected image.
	This process can be done for one or more energy bands.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	For recently-processed data the script can be run with only
	two parameters: for example

	<ITEM>out/merged_evt.fits, the merged events file, and</ITEM>
	<ITEM>out/broad&flname;, the exposure-corrected

      <PARA>
	We took advantage of the
	<HREF link="https://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/stack.html">stack support</HREF>
	to process all the directories that match "*/repro/" -
	the quotes are needed to ensure that the shell does not do the
	matching, which would result in a parameter file error - and
	then looking for event files in these directories (see the
	description of the infile parameter for a full discussion of
	what file names are searched for).
	The examples below show other ways to use the stack support
	for specifying files.
      </PARA>

      <PARA title="How is &mname; better than merge_all?">
	The merge_all script combines the reprojected event
	files, then creates a single multi-chip exposure map for this
	file. The &mname; script creates exposure maps for each
	of the individual (reprojected) observations and then sums the resulting
	counts and exposure map images.
	The method merge_all uses does not correctly handle the case
	when observations were not taken with the same settings, such
	as differences in the SIM_X and SIM_Z values. This can lead
	to discrepencies between where the software calculates that chip edges
	and bad columns should be (when creating response functions like
	the exposure map or ARF) and where they actually are.
	The merge_all script does not use the observation-specific
	bad-pixel, mask, and DTF files, which means that
	certain instrumental effects (e.g. bad pixels, ACIS subarrays,
	cosmic-ray dead-time correction) are not included in the
	exposure map it creates. It also can not include variations in
	the response over time - e.g. when combining observations separated
	by multiple years, time dependent quantities, such as the
	amount of contamination on the ACIS optical-blocking filters,
	are not handled correctly.
      </PARA>
      <PARA>
	The extra steps taken by &mname; means it can take longer to
	run, but the script can do many of these in parallel if your
	machine has multiple processors, which can reduce this overhead.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	If you only wish to reproject the event files and merge them - i.e.
	you do not want the images or exposure maps - then you can
	use the &rname; script.
      </PARA>

      <PARA title="The &mname;, &rname; and &fname; scripts">
	The &mname; script combines the &rname; and &fname; script,
	so if you need more control, or wish to create exposure-corrected
	images with multiple bin sizes or grids, then it is suggested
	that you use &rname; and &fname; instead.
      </PARA>

      <PARA title="WCS alignment">
	The individual event files are reprojected to the same tangent point,
	but no attempt is made to align the observations. If you find that
	the WCS of the individual observations are not aligned - e.g. you
	can see "double" sources in the reprojected, merged data - then
	you need to update the WCS before running &mname;. An
	example is the

	  For each new event, file images, exposure maps, exposure-corrected

          are created for the requested list of bands.
	  An optional thresholding step is applied to both the
