    <SYNOPSIS>
       Adjust input map file to meet some minimum criteria
    </SYNOPSIS>
    <DESC>
        <PARA>
        The output maps from various adaptive binning routines
        may contain small, insignificant groups which were 
        the result of filling in the gaps between neighboring 
        groups.  The merge_too_small script reassigns these
        small regions to the smallest neighbor (by default).  The 
        script will identify groups with a small geometric
        area (ie few pixels), or with low number of counts 
        (requires imgfile be supplied).
        </PARA>
        <PARA>
        The deficient groups are merged in to the 
        smallest neighboring group by default; where smallest is the 
        same metric (smallest area or fewest counts).  The join parameter
        can be used to change the logic and assign deficient groups to the
        largest neighboring group.
        </PARA>
        <PARA>
        The output is a new map file with the deficient 
        regions pixel values replaced with the largest or smallest neighbor.
        </PARA>
        <PARA>
        With method=area, the minvalue is the minimum number of image 
        (ie logical) pixels a group can contain.  With method=counts,
        the minvalue is the minimum sum of pixel values obtained
        from imgfile.  The imgfile typically will be a counts image; 
        however, it could also be exposure corrected and|or background
        subtracted.        
        </PARA>
        <PARA>
        This script does not preserve any morphology imposed by the
        tool which created the input map.  For example, if the
        input map was created by following some contours, the
        output map will not adhere to that constraint.  Similarly, if
        the input has some geometric shape (circle, square, hexagon,etc)
        the output will not preserve that geometry.

                Takes the input map file, scales.map, and identifies 
                all the groups with 10 or fewer image pixels (ie logical
                pixels).  Those groups are merged into their neighboring
                groups with the largest area.  The updated map
                file is written to the outfile, scales_min10px.map.

            <PARA>
            Taking the output from the previous example, we now
            identify any groups which contain fewer than 100
            counts and merge them into their neighbor with the 
            most counts.
            The imgfile, img.fits, must be supplied so
            we can obtain the counts.

            This is the same as the previous example with the addition of
            setting the parameter join=max.  With this change, deficient
            groups are assigned to the largest adjacent neighbor rather
            than the largest.

        Added the join parameter to control the logic to use when

        initial release of the tool indicated that it was using the
