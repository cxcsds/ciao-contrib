	The check_ciao_version tool allows users to easily
	check that the CIAO and
	CIAO Calibration Database (CALDB) installations are up
	to date. It compares the dates of the installed components
	against the latest-released versions and prints out those
	elements that need upgrading.
	The script requires internet access
	since it has to download information from the
	CXC web site.
      </PARA>
      <PARA title="Tool behavior">
	The tool prints messages to the screen and exits with a status
	of 0 when everything is up to date or non-zero when
	something needs updating.
      </PARA>
      <PARA title="How do I upgrade my system: conda">
	The 'conda update' command can be used to update a conda-installed
	version of CIAO, and the script will detail the necessary
	arguments.
      </PARA>
      <PARA title="How do I upgrade my system: ciao-install">
	If the tool finds that your CIAO or CALDB installations are
	out of date then it will point you to the <HREF

	download page</HREF>, from which the ciao-install script can
	be downloaded. This script will perform the necessary updates.
