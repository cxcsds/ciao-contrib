    <SYNOPSIS>
        Convert a map file into a region file.
    </SYNOPSIS>
    <DESC>
        <PARA>
        This script creates a polygon region around each 
        unique set of pixel values in the input map file.
        The `dmimglasso' tool is used to identify the 
        polygons.  The polgyons may contain multiple components
        if there is a hole in the interior (eg a separate
        group completely surrounded by another group).
        </PARA>
        <PARA>
        This script assumes that all groups are contiguous.  If 
        a group is split into multiple disjoint sections then
        only 1 of those sub-groups will be processed.        
        </PARA>
        
        <PARA>
        Only pixel values greater than zero (&gt;0) are considered.
        Pixel values equal to zero are considered as being ungrouped.            
        </PARA>
        <PARA>
        This script runs in parallel; though for a large number of unique
        map IDs it can still be slow.
        </PARA>

        <PARA>
        The map values in the infile are not the same as the
        COMPONENT values in the output region file.

            Convert the map file,  hex.map, into an ASC-FITS format
            region file, hex.reg.  We then use ds9 to display
            the results.

            <PARA>
                The map file should contain integer pixel values which
                represent which pixels are grouped together.
                Pixel values equal to 0 are ignored (treated as being
                ungrouped).

            <PARA>
                The output is stored as an ASC-FITS format region
                file.  Each map ID in the input image will be output
                as one or more polygons.  The map ID is 
                not stored (it is not guaranteed to be the COMPONENT 
                value).  Each component may have interior polygons
                excluded if they completely surround another 
                group (or an ungrouped area).

            Due to continued problems writing the output file for 
            large number of regions, needed to re-write the 
            code that creates the output file. Now runs much faster
            and uses much less memory.

      <PARA>
        Internal changes to fix possible crash when dealing with 
        large regions, eg polygons with many sides.  The tool
        may require more memory and run slower but should now be more
        robust.
