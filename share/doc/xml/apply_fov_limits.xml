    <SYNOPSIS>Create an image that matches the FOV file for the observation</SYNOPSIS>
    <DESC>
      <PARA>
	The apply_fov_limits tool takes an event file and creates
	an image from it in SKY coordinates, calculating the limits
        from the Field-Of-View (FOV) file for the observation.
	The default mode is to create the FOV based on the aspect
        solution of the observation, filtered by the GTI of the
	event file, but a FOV file can also be given.
	It is essentially get_fov_limits followed by a dmcopy
	call; the
        <HREF
	    link="https://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/get_fov_limits.html">help
	file for get_fov_limits</HREF>
        describes how the limits are calculated.

	    The tool creates the file img.fits, which is an image of
	    the data in evt2.fits, binned to cover the spatial extent
	    of the observation. The default binning is used (8 pixels
	    for ACIS and 32 for HRC) and, as no Data Model filters
	    were applied to the event file, all the data will be
	    included in the output image.

	    When set to INDEF a default value is used:
	    8 for ACIS data and 32 for HRC data.
	    The binning factor has units of the
	    SKY pixel (0.492" for ACIS and 0.1318" for HRC),
	    so binsize=4 for an ACIS observation will create
	    images with 1.968 arcsecond pixels.
	    The value need not be an integer, and can be less
	    than 1 if you want to look at small-scale structure near
	    the aim point of the observation; in this case it is strongly
	    suggested that a ccd_id filter is used to ensure
	    manageable file sizes.

	The output image is no-longer created with the dmcopy option=all
