    <SYNOPSIS>
      Find the matching HRC "blank-sky" dataset (event file or spectrum) for an observation
    </SYNOPSIS>

    <DESC>
      <PARA>
	The hrc_bkgrnd_lookup script is used to find the HRC-I
	background (i.e. "blank sky") dataset from the CALDB that
	matches your observation. 
	Unlike acis_bkgrnd_lookup the HRC background datasets
	come in two types - event or spectrum - and
	are generated from stowed observations (where the HRC
	is not at the focal plane of the Chandra mirrors).
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	Please see the following HRC threads:
	<HREF
	link="https://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/hrci_bg_events/">The
	HRC-I Background Event Files</HREF> and
	<HREF
	link="https://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/hrci_bg_spectra/">The
	HRC-I Background Spectra Files</HREF>.
	Note that there are no versions of these datasets for
	HRC-S observations.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	The results of the CALDB search are written to the outfile
	parameter as well as being written to the screen, making them
	accessible by calling:

	    In most cases the default verbose level (of 0)
