    <SYNOPSIS>
      Generate a photometric lightcurve from ACA monitor data.
    </SYNOPSIS>

      <PARA> 
	The Aspect Camera Assembly (ACA) on Chandra is part of the
        Pointing Control and Aspect Determination (PCAD) System,
        and is used to track the location of 
        guide stars during an observation. The ACA can
	monitor one star during an observation, rather
        than use it to track the pointing of the spacecraft. For
	observations
	where this option was selected, the standard data products
	(SDP) include the monitor data in the pcad*adat71.fits
        files (the "7" indicates the ACA slot number, which is always
        7 for the monitor data).
	The monitor_photom script is used to convert this data into
        a photometric lightcurve for further processing.

    <ADESC title="How is the light curve generated?">
      <PARA> 
        The basic idea of the detection algorithm is to sample pixels
        from the outer edge of the readout window and look for values
        higher than a threshold. At the edge, the contamination of the 
        dark current measurement from the monitor star is minimized.
        Since the readout window moves with respect to the CCD due to
        dither, the edge pixels end up sampling much of the CCD region
        used for imaging. In this way one can build up a map of warm
        pixels.

	  Read the image data file.

        <ITEM>
	  Median filter image data in time on a pixel-by-pixel basis
	  to remove cosmic rays. 
	</ITEM>

        <ITEM>
	  Search for "warm" pixels that have a dark current well
	  outside the normal distribution. These pixels can
	  significantly affect photometry as they dither in and out of
	  the 8x8 pixel image readout window. 
	</ITEM>

        <ITEM>
	  Subtract the background from each image readout. For warm
	  pixels the detected value for that pixel is used, while for
	  all others the median background dark current reported by
	  the ACA is used.

      <LIST>
        <ITEM>
	  Background pixel sampling is not complete nor uniform.
	</ITEM>

        <ITEM>
	  For brighter stars, even the edge pixels have significant
	  contribution from the star light so it is not possible to
	  get a true dark current measurement. The "dark_ratio"
	  parameter specifies that the warm pixel threshold be no less
	  than dark_ratio * avg_source_counts.  
	</ITEM>

        <ITEM>
	  The current algorithm does not account for flickering pixels where
      the dark current fluctuates between two or more values.
