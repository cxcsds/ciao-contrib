    <SYNOPSIS>
       Adaptively bin an image using centroid map algorithm
    </SYNOPSIS>
    <DESC>
        <PARA>
        The centroid_map tool implements an iterative adaptive binning 
        routine.  First, the tool determines the location of the local
        maxima in the input image.  The location of these maxima are called
        'sites'.  It then performs a Voronoi Tessellation
        to determine the convex hull polygons around each initial site.
        This is done using the vtbin tool.
        Next it computes the centroid of the pixel values enclosed in each
        polygon. Theses centroid are then used as the sites for the next
        iteration.  The tessellation and centroid process is repeated
        the user-specified number of iterations.
        </PARA>
        <PARA>
        It can be shown that this algorithm will eventually converge
        (ie the sites do not change between iterations).  However, it
        may converge slowly where most of the sites remain fixed and only
        a few sites take many iterations to converge.  This is why the
        number of iterations is left as a user parameter.  Typical values
        will be in the 30-150 range.  
        </PARA>
        <PARA>
        Users can also supply their own initial site file (rather than
        use the location of the local maxima).  This allows the user 
        to control the initial location of the site and to control the total
        number of site locations.  The number of sites is fixed; 
        neighboring sites cannot 'merge' together.
        </PARA>
        <PARA>
        The input image should be smoothed.  Since the tool 
        determines the location of local maxima in a 5x5 pixel neighborhood, 
        the input should be smoothed at least on that scale.
        </PARA>
        <PARA>
        The output from the centroid_map tool is the map file: an image
        whose pixel values indicate which pixels are grouped together.
        Users can use the dmmaskbin tool to create a binned imaged.

            First the input image is smoothed with a 3-pixel sigma Gaussian.
            Then we compute the centroid_map using this smoothed image, using
            30 iterations.

            In this example we start by adaptively smoothing the 
            input image.  We then locate the local maximum in a larger
            7x7 pixel region, and then use dmimgblob to label local max 
            with a unique value to create the sites.fits files.

            In this example we want to use a random starting location for
            the sites.  To do this, we use the sherpa fake() command
            with a flat, 2D constant model with a Poisson rate of 0.005 
            counts per pixel.  We then use the dmimgthresh command to 
            remove sites that are off the detector (in parts of the smoothed
            image which are zero). Then we use dmimgblob as before to
            assign a unique label to each site.

            The centroid_map will eventually converge to a state
            where the sites no longer move.  However, it can
            converge very slowly, where only a few sites at the
            end take a large number of iterations to become fixed.
            Rather than try to guess when the algorithm has converged 
            "enough", the script uses the numiter parameter to
            control the number of iterations.  Typical values will 
            be on the order of 30 to 150 iterations.

                If not specified, the centroid_map begins by

                all the local maxima in 5x5 regions.  This fixes
