    <SYNOPSIS>
        Correct a Chandra aspect solution for temporal drift
        calculated from a fit of the drift in the sky positions of the
        events in a supplied circle region.
    </SYNOPSIS>

    <DESC>
      <PARA>
        Thermal cycling on the spacecraft can result in an apparent
        temporal drift of the sky position of an X-ray source during
        an observation.  This appears as a drift of up to about 0.5
        arcsec in X-ray event sky X, Y coordinates over time.  Because
        of the thermal variation time scales, this effect is usually
        most prominent in long observations (more than about 50 ksec).
      </PARA>
      <PARA>
        As of DS 8.4, a drift correction is applied to the aspect
        solution using the periscope gradients telemetry.  However,
        temporal drifts have continued to increase with thermal
        variation of the spacecraft.  Therefore the Aspect team
        suggests that to accomplish science related to sub-arcsec
        source structure, users should follow this thread to correct
        residual drift induced by the periscope.  This requires a
        relatively bright, on-axis source (within a few arcmin
        off-axis angle) to perform a "self-calibration" of the aspect
        solution.
      </PARA>
      <PARA>
        This tool takes as input a source aspect solution and event
        files and returns a new/corrected aspect solution that may be
        applied to the events to correct residual temporal drift.
      </PARA>
      <PARA title="WARNING: do not apply without review">
	The tool creates four plots as part of the output (they
	end in _yag.png and _zag.png). These must be reviewed before
	the correction is used, to ensure that the automatic fitting
	process has not produced invalid results.

   <ADESC title="Caveats">
     <PARA title="Bad fits">
       This tool provides output plots of the fits of the
       events. The user must evaluate those plots to determine
       if a correction is warranted and if the output fit is
       reasonable. This tool *should not* be blindly applied to
       observations.
     </PARA>
     <PARA title="Counts needed for good fit">
       The tool is not intended for short observations (less than
       50ks) and will not work well for observations well without a
       bright point-like source.

       aspect solution files.
