        `qocat' queries the Chandra Observation Catalog (OCAT) for information 
        about the requested observation. The observation can be specified 
        by OBS_ID number, or by providing a Chandra event file name.        
        </PARA>
        <PARA>
        When given an OBS_ID, the selected information from the OCAT
        is displayed.  This includes the instrument configuration,
        the proposal and sequence numbers, and provides the text 
        of the proposal abstract.
        </PARA>
        <PARA>
    When given an event file, or the directory name where the tool can 
    locate an event file, the tool will use the OBS_ID header keyword
    to lookup information in the OCAT.  It will augment this with 
    additional information that is in file header which is not 
    available in the OCAT such as the SIM location, the mean pointing,
    and software+CALDB processing versions.

       Proposal Abstract : With the ASCA observations of the Rho Oph dark cloud,
                           we found variable hard X-ray emission from Class I
                           sources. A Class I (EL29) shows a flare like TTSs,
                           other (WL6) varies sinusoidally, suggesting rotation
                           period, and the other (YLW15) exhibit quasi-periodic
                           flares, suggestive for the star-disk magnetic
                           connection. Non X-ray emitting Class I is also found.
                           Our proposal is, with no source confusion problem, to
                           confirm these variety of X-ray activity, to search
                           for X-rays from other Class Is, as well as new X-ray
                           emitting young stellar objects, using ACIS with the
                           high spatial resolution up to 10 keV energy. Together
                           with the radio search of bipolar structure, and
                           comparison of TTSs, our goal is to give strong
                           constrain on the evolution and structure of
                           protostars.
