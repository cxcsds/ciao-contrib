	This script clears out several ACIS status bits that are set
	by the Chandra pipeline and that need to be cleared before
	using acis_process_events. This is needed to support the
	bad-pixel/afterglow pipeline. Please see
	the
	<HREF link="https://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/createL2/">Reprocessing
	Data to Create a New Level=2 Event File</HREF>
	thread for more information.

      <PARA>
	Unlike most CIAO scripts and tools, this script does not
	have a parameter file as there is only one argument,
	the file name of the event file to change. This change
	happens "in place", so ensure you either have a backup copy of the event file,
	or can re-create it, before using this script.

	The ACIS status column is a 32-bit value. This scripts clears
	- sets to 0 - bit numbers 1 to 5, 14 to 20, and 23.
	The numbering here matches that used in the
	<HREF link="https://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/dictionary/status.html">Status dictionary
	entry</HREF> on the CIAO web site.
      </PARA>
      <PARA>
	The scripts adds the CLSTBITS keywords to the file, with 
	a value showing the bit mask that was and-ed against each
	entry (so 0 means the bit was cleared and 1 means that the
	initial setting is retained). The example above shows
	the value used for this keyword.

	The CLSTBITS keyword is now correct on 32-bit machines.
	This problem only affected this header keyword; the
