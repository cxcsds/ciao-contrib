    <SYNOPSIS>
      Reprocess a Chandra dataset
    </SYNOPSIS>

    <DESC>
      <PARA>
	The chandra_repro reprocessing script automates the
	recommended data processing steps presented in the CIAO
	analysis threads.  The script reads data from the standard
	data distribution (e.g. primary and secondary directories) and
	creates a new bad pixel file, a new level=2 event file, and a
	new level=2 Type II PHA file with the appropriate response files (grating data only).
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	chandra_repro may be used to reprocess any ACIS and HRC imaging
	or grating data.  
      </PARA>

      <PARA> 
	There are parameters to control certain reprocessing steps,
	such as creating the new bad pixel file or destreaking the
	data.  Users who wish to have finer-grained control over the
	reprocessing parameters should instead follow the
	step-by-step instructions in
	the <HREF link="https://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/data.html">CIAO
	Data Preparation Threads</HREF>.
      </PARA>

      <PARA title="Where are the processed files?">
	The chandra_repro script stores the processed files in the location
	given by the outdir parameter. This can be relative to the input directory
	- e.g. a repro/ directory within each obsid - or everything can be
	placed into a single directory (when processing multiple directories).
	The grating products - PHA2, grating ARFs, and RMFs - 
	are placed in the tg/ subdirectory of the outroot
	directory.
      </PARA>
 
     <PARA title="CALDB Version">
     The chandra_repro script does not overwrite the CALDBVER keyword in
     the event header since not all calibrations may have been applied.
     However, it does record the version of the CALDB in comments that 
     users can check to verify that they applied the intended 
     calibration updates.

    <ADESC title="Changes in the December 2011 Release">
      <LIST>
	<ITEM>
	  The tools acis_find_afterglow (new in CIAO 4.4) and
	  acis_build_badpix are used in place of acis_run_hotpix
	  because acis_find_afterglow is more efficient at identifying
	  afterglows that have a small number (i.e. 4-10) of events. 
	</ITEM>

	<ITEM>
	  The status bits that are set by destreak or
	  acis_process_events are reset with the
	  acis_clear_status_bits script before the data are
	  reprocessed.  Previously, only the bits set by
	  acis_detect_afterglow were reset. 
	</ITEM>
	
	<ITEM>
	  The destreak tool is run before acis_find_afterglow to
	  improve the streak detection efficiency and to prevent
	  pixels with several streak events from being misidentified
	  as hot pixels. 
	</ITEM>

	<ITEM>
	  The default filename root is chosen from the first segment
	  of the level=1 event file, e.g. changed from
	  "acisf01838_000N002" to "acisf01838".

   <ADESC title="Caveats">
     <LIST>
       <ITEM>Large Datasets:  chandra_repro uncompresses files in memory before using them.
       This may consume too much memory on some machines and cause 
       chandra_repro to fail.  Since chandra_repro can work with files that
       have already been gunziped, the work around is to gunzip all
       the files before running this tool.
       </ITEM>
       <ITEM>Multi-obi datasets:  as noted above, multi-obi
       obsids need to be separated before running chandra_repro,
       which can be performed by the splitobs script.</ITEM>
