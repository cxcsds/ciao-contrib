    <SYNOPSIS>
     Filters input event file based on time spent in calibrated focal plane temperature ranges.
    </SYNOPSIS>
    <DESC>
      <PARA>
        This script automates the event filtering steps shown in the
        <HREF link="https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/acis-fptemp-resp/index.html">
        Extracting Spectra and Responses for ACIS Observations that Undergo Large 
        Focal-plane Temperature Swings
        </HREF> thread. The script will use the input event file to identify
        the set of 
        <HREF link="https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/ciao/why/mkacisrmf.html">mkacisrmf</HREF>,
        i.e. the "P2_RESP" CALDB files.
        If there are multiple CALDB files, then the script will use the information in
        the headers of the "P2_RESP" calibration files to identify the 
        calibrated focal-plane temperature ranges. The script constructs good
        time intervals based on the temperature ranges and FP_TEMP values 
        stored in the mission time line file. For temperature ranges with
        non-zero good time, it will then filter the event file using those
        good time intervals.
        The output is a set of event files and a stack "list" file than can 
        then be used with specextract to extract combined spectra.
     </PARA>

     <PARA title="Caveat">
       This script and the thread are not needed for most observations.
       Even if there is a significant temperature variation during an observation, 
       most targets will not have enough counts to be able to differentiate between
       statistical uncertainty and temperature dependent calibration differences.
       Users should read the thread and associated documents carefully before
       using this script.            
     </PARA>
     <PARA>
        As of CIAO 4.18/CALDB 4.12.2, the only CCDs with temperature dependent
        RMF calibrations are ACIS 0, 1, 2,3, and 6.  There is no temperature
        dependent calibrations available for the other CCDs. Therefore if your
        source is located on ACIS 4, 5, 7, 8 or 9, there is no reason to 
        use this script.

            This example shows running the script with the event file 
            for OBS_ID 30601 as input. The script used the event file to locate
            the set of P2_RESP CALDB files, extracted the FP_TEMP ranges, created
            good time intervals, and then filtered the event file into 6
            segments consistent with the FP_TEMP ranges for the 6 non-zero
            good time intervals.  The script was able to automatically locate
            the mission time line file (MTL) based on the MTLFILE keyword
            in the input event file.

<PARA>
For OBS_ID 214 there are not P2_RESP calibration files. This observation
was taken early in the mission and requires using the 'mkrmf' tool 
rather than the 'mkacisrmf' tool to create response matrix files (RMFs). There are no
temperature dependent calibrations during this early mission time period.

    <ADESC title="Background Information">
     <PARA >
        For most of the Chandra mission the ACIS focal plane temperature
        has remained steady at/around -120C. However as the mission has
        progressed it has become difficult to maintain a steady temperature
        and at the same time preserve observing efficiency. As a result, the ACIS 
        focal plane temperature is now allowed to vary during an some observations.
        Changes in focal plane temperature affect the spectral re-distribution;
        that is warmer temperatures produce wider observed spectral lines.
        The response matrix, RMF, has been calibrated for several temperature
        ranges for certain CCD_IDs (chips).
