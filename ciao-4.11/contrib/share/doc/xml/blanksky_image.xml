    <SYNOPSIS>
      Create scaled background and background-subtracted images given an
      observation-specific blanksky background file and a reference image. 
    </SYNOPSIS>
    
    <DESC> 
      <PARA>
	This script will create a scaled background image and
	background-subtracted image, given a customized blanksky
	background events file and reference FITS image. 
      </PARA>
      <PARA>
	The needed ACIS blanksky background files are selected for
	the observation and then processed as outlined in
	the <HREF link="http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/acisbackground/#acisbg">"Analysing
	the ACIS Background with the 'Blank-Sky' Files"</HREF>
	analysis thread and HRC-I observations, processing the particle background
	files are described
	in <HREF link="http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/hrci_bg_events/">The
	HRC-I Background Event Files</HREF>; these threads are
	automated by the "blanksky" script.   Multi-CCD observations
	will be scaled on a per chip basis, using the chip-appropriate
	BKGSCALn header keywords to produce the background image.
	Energy and PI filters applied to the reference image file -- for
	ACIS and HRC-I observations, respectively -- will also be
	applied to the background image.  
      </PARA>

	    For a given blanksky background event file, "bsky.fits"
	    and a FITS counts image of an observation, "src.img", the scaled
	    background and background-subtracted images
	    "obs_particle_bgnd.img" and "obs_particle_bkgsub.img", or  
	    "obs_time_bgnd.img" and "obs_time_bkgsub.img" will be
	    created, dependent on the BKGMETH header keyword of the
	    blanksky background events file.  If the reference image
	    was created with fluximage, then the output images will
	    use the same binning and sky range as the reference image.

    <ADESC title="Determining background scaling factor for an observation">
      <PARA>
	The background scaling method and factor are stored in the
	BKGMETH and BKGSCALE/BKGSCALn header keywords in the tailored blanksky
	background file, each BKGSCALn value corresponds to a specific
	chip.  These scaling values may be used to weigh FITS image
	files, on a per chip basis for an observation. 
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	When scaling by time, the ratio of the observation to blanksky
	files' LIVTIMEn keywords are calculated.  
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	The basis for scaling by the high-energy particle background is described
	in <HREF link="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...645...95H">"Absolute
	Measurement of the Unresolved Cosmic X-Ray Background in the
	0.5-8 keV Band with Chandra" (Hickox &amp; Markevitch, ApJ 645
	95)</HREF>.  The calculation of the factors are done by taking the
	ratio of the counts in the observation to the blanksky
	background for each chip in a defined hard energy band (the
	"bkgparams" parameter in the "blanksky" script).
