      <PARA>
	This script takes the output of the roi tool - a set of
	FITS files, one per source, each with a SRCREG and BKGREG block - 
	and converts them into ASCII region files that can be used
	by dmfilth.
	Please see the

	of Diffuse Emission</HREF>
	thread for more information.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	Unlike most CIAO scripts and tools, this script does not
	have a parameter file. It will also over-write any existing
	file; those called outhead + ".src.reg" and outhead + ".bg.reg".
      </PARA>

      <PARA title="Viewing the output in ds9">
	The script creates two ASCII region files: outhead.src.reg and
	outhead.bg.reg. In all but the most-simple cases these files
	can not be directly viewed by ds9. The dmmakereg tool can be
	used to convert to a FITS region file, and that can then be
	read by ds9. For example, assuming that splitroi has been
	run with the outhead argument set to sources, then

	  <PARA>
	    Here we convert the src*fits files created by roi into
	    two ASCII region files - sources.src.reg and sources.bg.reg
	    - which can then be used as the values of the
	    srclist and bkglist parameters of dmfilth. For example:

	      <LINE>&pr; pset dmfilth bkglist=@sources.bg.reg</LINE>
	    </SYNTAX>
	  </PARA>
	  <PARA>
	    The \ in src\*fits is needed to ensure that the script, rather than
	    the shell, does the file search. The following example shows other
	    ways that multiple files can be passed through to the script.

	    is to use the "@" syntax to read in the names from a file, e.g.

    <ADESC title="Changes in scripts 4.11.1 (December 2018) release">
      <PARA>
        Updated to restore the use of the region string "point(0,0)" for
        empty regions.  In CIAO 4.10, the output would contain blank
        lines for empty regions; blank lines are skipped when 
        the files are processed as stacks which could cause 
        a mismatch in source to background mapping.
