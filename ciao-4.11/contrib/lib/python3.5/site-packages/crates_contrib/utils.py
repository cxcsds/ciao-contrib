        case each row of the table contains an array. It is expected
        that this is a NumPy array, but any iterable can be used.

    Parameters

    *args
        One or more data values. The supported variants are listed
        below in the Notes section.
    colnames : list, optional
        This argument determines the names and orders of the
        columns that are written out. Its meaning depents on the
        form of the input data, as discussed in the Notes section
        below.

    Returns
    -------
    tcrate
        A table crate which contains the column values and has
        some metadata items attached to it (CREATOR and DATE
        keywords).

    See Also
    --------
    add_colvals, make_image_crate, write_arrays, write_columns

    Notes
    -----
    If called with one argument and it acts as a dictionary then
    the keys of the value are taken to be the column names and
    the values are the columns. Use a collections.OrderedDict
    to ensure the column order, since it's taken to be the
    key order returned by the dictionary. The order can be over-ridden
    with the colnames argument (this also lets you write out only
    a subset of the keys in the dictionary).

    If a single argument is used that is a stuctured array then
    the column names, order, and data is taken from the array. As
    with dictionaries the colnames argument can be used to re-order
    or subset the data.

    The arguments are taken to be the column data to use. If they are
    not the same length then the smaller arrays will be padded with
    the null value for that column type (0 for numeric columns and
    "IND" or "" for string columns). The arrays can be Python arrays
    or numpy arrays, and include strings. Python arrays should contain
    the same data type for each element; if this does not hold then
    there is no guarantee as to the behavior of this routine.

    When a dictionary or structured array is supplied then the colnames
    argument, if set, is used to order the columns in the crate.
    Columns in the input argument but not mentioned in colnames are
    excluded.

    Otherwise, the colnames argument is used to name the columns. If
    left as None then the names "col1" to "coln" will be used (n being
    the number of columns).

    The semantics of whether the input array(s) are copied or
    just referenced in the crate are currently not specified.
    Changing the original array after the crate has been created
    *may* change the value in the Crate, but this behavior should
    not be taken advantage of.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> a = [1,2,3,4,5]
    >>> b = ["aa", "bb", "", "d d", "long string"]
    >>> c = np.arange(10).reshape((5,2))
    >>> cr1 = make_table_crate(a, b)

def smooth_image_crate(cr, stype, *args, **kwargs):
    """Smooth the pixel values in the crate.

    This changes the pixel values stored in the image crate
    but retains other metadata, such as WCS mapping.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cr
        The IMAGECrate to change.
    stype : str
        The type of smoothing to apply. The list of supported
        values is given in the Notes section below.
    *args, **kwargs
        The supported arguments depend on the value of the
        'stype' argument.

    See Also
    --------
    scale_image_crate

    Notes
    -----
    The supported smoothing types, and their arguments, are given
    below, where function indicates which function from
    ciao_contrib.smooth is used to smooth the image (it also
    determines the meaning of the "args and kwargs" column):

    ======= =========== ======== =================================
    stype   smoothing   function args and kwargs
    ======= =========== ======== =================================
    none    none
    gauss   gaussian    gsmooth  sigma, hwidth=5
    boxcar  box-car     bsmooth  radius
    tophat  top-hat     tsmooth  radius
    file    by file     fsmooth  filename, norm=True, origin=None
    image   by image    ismooth  kernel, norm=True, origin=None
    ======= =========== ======== =================================

    Numeric values such as sigma and radius refer to logical
    pixels, and not SKY or WCS units.

    This routine modifies the data in the input crate, it does
    *NOT* return a copy of the crate.

    Examples
    --------

    Smooth the data with a gaussian with a 3-pixel sigma, using
    a box half-width of 5 sigmaL

    >>> cr = read_file('img.fits')
    >>> smooth_image_crate(cr, 'gauss', 3)

    Change to use a bow half-width of 7 sigma:

    >>> cr = read_file('img.fits')
    >>> smooth_image_crate(cr, 'gauss', sigma=3, hwidth=7)

    Smooth the pixel values in chandra.img by the image stored in
    xmm_psf.fits:

    >>> cr = read_file('chandra.img')
    >>> smooth_image_crate(cr, 'file', 'xmm_psf.fits')

    Create a three-by-three kernel and use it to smooth the image
    stored in cr:

    >>> kern = np.asarray([0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0]).reshape(3, 3)
    >>> smooth_image_crate(cr, 'image', kern)
